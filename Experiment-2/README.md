## ðŸš€ Steps Followed to Build This Project

1. **Created the basic HTML structure**
   - Used `<!DOCTYPE html>` and included all necessary tags (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
   - Added `<meta charset="UTF-8">` for character encoding.
   - Set the page title to `"Responsing Banking UI"`.
   - Linked an external CSS file using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.

2. **Built the main layout inside the `<body>`**
   - Created `.outer-container` to center everything.
   - Nested `.inner-container` for the balance and buttons section.

3. **Added balance display**
   - Inserted a `div` with the class `balance` showing the initial amount (`$0`).

4. **Added Deposit and Withdraw buttons**
   - Created a `div` named `.buttons` to contain the buttons.
   - Added two `<button>` elements: one with class `.deposit`, the other with `.withdraw`.

5. **Styled the page using CSS**
   - Set the body background to dark.
   - Used Flexbox to center elements vertically and horizontally.
   - Applied `Arial, sans-serif` for the font.

6. **Styled containers**
   - `.outer-container`: light grey background, fixed size, padding.
   - `.inner-container`: white background, border-radius, box-shadow for card effect.

7. **Styled balance text**
   - Increased font size, weight, and used a green color for the balance display.

8. **Styled buttons**
   - Stack buttons vertically using Flexbox with spacing (`gap: 10px`).
   - `.deposit` button: green color and hover effect.
   - `.withdraw` button: red color and hover effect.
   - Smooth transitions, padding, border-radius for a clean UI experience.
