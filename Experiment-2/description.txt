What I Did to Make My Simple Banking UI

1. Planned What I Wanted
I decided to make a simple banking page that shows a balance (starting at $0) and has two buttons: Deposit and Withdraw. 
The design should be neat, centered on the screen, and easy to understand for beginners.

2. Created My Project Files
I made two files: one for the HTML (the structure) and one for the CSS (the styling). 
I named them index.html and style.css.

3. Wrote the HTML Structure
- I made a main container (outer-container) to help center everything on the page.
- Inside that, I added another container (inner-container) which acts like the white card you see.
- Inside that card, I put a place to show the balance ($0).
- Below that, I added two buttons stacked vertically: a green Deposit button and a red Withdraw button.

4. Connected the CSS File
I linked my stylesheet (style.css) inside the HTML so that when the page loads, it uses the styles I wrote.

5. Styled the Page with CSS
- I made the background of the whole page dark, so the white card stands out.
- Used flexbox to center the card perfectly in the middle of the screen.
- Gave the card a white background with rounded corners and a slight shadow to make it look like a real card.
- Made the balance text bigger and green-ish to catch the eye.
- Stacked the buttons vertically with some space between them.
- Made the buttons fill the card’s width, gave them rounded corners, and made the Deposit button green and the Withdraw button red.

6. Added Button Hover Effects
When you move your mouse over the buttons, their colors get a bit darker, so it looks like they’re clickable.

7. Final Touches
- Set smooth transitions so that the color changes don’t happen abruptly.
- Used a simple, readable font to make everything clear.
- Adjusted spacing to keep the design balanced and clean.

8. What’s Next (for Later)
I thought about making the design work well on smaller devices and adding code so the buttons really interact with the balance (like increasing or decreasing it). 
But for now, the focus was just on making the UI look good 

Basically, I planned my layout, built the structure using HTML, styled everything with CSS to look nice and centered, 
and made sure buttons have nice colors and hover effects to look interactive.
