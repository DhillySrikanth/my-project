Experiment 4 : Dynamic Product Filter


In this experiment, I created a simple web page that displays a list of products, and the user can filter them by selecting a category.

To make the page dynamic, I stored all the products and categories in JavaScript arrays instead of writing them directly in HTML. 
From the category array, I automatically filled the dropdown menu using a loop. This way, there was no need to write <option> tags manually in HTML.

The product array contains objects where each product has a name and category. Whenever the user selects a category from the dropdown,
a function runs that checks every product one by one. If the product belongs to the selected category, it gets displayed; otherwise, it remains hidden.

For this, I used important DOM methods such as createElement, appendChild, and also updated the innerHTML of the product list to show the correct items. 
I also added an event listener on the dropdown, so whenever the category changes, the products update instantly without refreshing the page.

In the CSS part, I styled the container with borders, padding, and rounded corners, and kept everything centered so the page looks clean and organized.
Overall, this experiment helped me understand how JavaScript arrays, event handling, and DOM manipulation work together to create interactive web applications in a practical way.
