Experiment 6 : SVG Drawing Tool

In this experiment, I made a small drawing tool using an SVG element. The SVG acts like a canvas where the user can draw freehand lines using their mouse.

In the HTML, 
I created an <svg> element inside a container. This is the main drawing area where users can sketch.
I also added a heading for the title and my name below it.

In the CSS, 
I styled the page to look clean and balanced. The SVG was given a fixed width and height, a border, and a light background color. 
I also changed the cursor to a crosshair so it feels like a drawing application. The container was centered with some padding and borders.

In the JavaScript, 
I used mouse events to make drawing possible:
1. When the user presses the mouse button (mousedown), a new SVG path is created and drawing starts from that point.
2. As the user moves the mouse (mousemove), line segments are continuously added to the path, giving the effect of freehand drawing.
3. When the user releases the mouse (mouseup), the current path is completed and stored in the SVG.

To create each stroke, I used createElementNS for making a new <path> element inside SVG, and updated its d attribute with the current mouse coordinates. 
Each line is styled in blue color, has a stroke width of 2px, and no fill.

So basically, the whole logic works like this:
Mouse Down : Start drawing a new path
Mouse Move : Add line segments to the path
Mouse Up : Stop drawing and save the path

Overall, this experiment helped me understand how SVG elements, event listeners, 
and DOM manipulation work together to create an interactive drawing tool inside a web page.
